# Research Context: ML-Based FCF Forecasting & DCF Valuation for NEPSE Hydropower Firms

This file is a self-contained context document for an academic research project. It is intended to be pasted into any LLM session to bring it up to speed on the study design, data plan, and feature set without needing prior conversation history.

## 1. Research Title (working)

**Machine Learning vs. Traditional Forecasting of Free Cash Flow for Discounted Cash Flow Valuation: Evidence from NEPSE-Listed Hydropower Firms**

> Note: This study was originally scoped around NEPSE-listed *manufacturing* firms (cement, beverage, consumer goods — only ~16 listed companies). It has been **switched to the hydropower sector**, which has 105 NEPSE-listed companies, giving a much larger and more homogeneous panel. All methodology below reflects the hydropower version.

## 3. Research Gap

Most Nepali valuation studies:
- Use historical growth assumptions
- Use ratio analysis
- Use basic DCF

Almost none:
- Forecast FCF using machine learning
- Compare ML against traditional forecasting methods
- Study NEPSE-listed **hydropower** firms specifically, despite
6. **Valuation Metrics (Y):** 
The model specifically engineers the target variable to predict the **Percentage Growth Rate** of Free Cash Flow, rather than Absolute Rupees. The literature confirms this prevents the algorithm from anchoring to the sheer size (Revenue) of the company, forcing it to learn the nuances of operational efficiency (PLF) and systemic macro-shocks (Inflation). improve Free Cash Flow forecasting and DCF valuation accuracy for NEPSE-listed hydropower firms — a sector with structurally distinct, nonlinear cash flow dynamics (construction-phase capex, regime shift at commercial operation date, seasonal hydrology-driven revenue) that traditional linear forecasting methods are poorly suited to capture.

## 4. Research Questions

- **RQ1:** Can ML models forecast FCF more accurately than traditional statistical methods for NEPSE-listed hydropower firms?
- **RQ2:** Which variables most influence future FCF in this sector (financial, operational, and macro/hydrology)?
- **RQ3:** How does ML-based DCF valuation differ from traditional DCF valuation, and which is closer to actual market capitalization?

## 5. Why Hydropower Instead of Manufacturing (rationale, for methodology/justification section)

1. **Sample size:** 105 listed companies vs. ~16 for manufacturing — enables a real panel rather than a thin one.
2. **Homogeneity:** Hydropower firms mostly sell to a single buyer (Nepal Electricity Authority, NEA) under broadly similar PPA structures, unlike manufacturing which spans cement/beverage/consumer goods with very different cost structures. A more homogeneous panel helps ML models generalize.
3. **Genuine nonlinearity in FCF:** Manufacturing FCF is roughly linear (steady operating cash flow minus modest maintenance capex) — exactly the regime where linear regression already performs well, weakening the case for ML. Hydropower FCF is structurally nonlinear: large negative FCF during construction (debt-funded capex), a sharp regime shift at COD (commercial operation date), and strong seasonality (wet vs. dry season generation). This gives a real economic mechanism for why tree-based/ML models should outperform linear models — not just "ML is fashionable."
4. **Richer, sector-specific predictor set:** installed capacity, plant load factor, years since COD, hydrology year-type, royalty regime, PPA tariff structure — none of which has an analogue in the manufacturing version, and which produce a much richer SHAP/interpretability narrative.

## 6. Key Methodological Risks / Decisions (already discussed, decisions logged)

- **Pre-COD vs. post-COD years:** Pre-COD FCF is mechanically just "large negative number driven by capex disbursement schedule" — not genuinely forecastable operating cash flow. Including it risks inflating apparent model accuracy (predicting "large negative" is easy) while diluting the operating-FCF story.
  - **Decision: Include all years (bigger N)** — user has explicitly chosen this over post-COD-only, accepting the tradeoff above. This should be disclosed as a limitation, and a pre/post-COD flag must be retained in the panel so it can be used as a control variable or basis for a robustness-check subsample.
- **Unbalanced panel:** NEPSE hydro listings span IPOs from the early 2000s through 2024–2025. Some companies will contribute ~12–14 years of data, others only 2–3. This must be handled explicitly (e.g., as an unbalanced panel in the econometric sense), not treated as a data inconvenience to paper over.
- **Terminal value horizon:** Hydropower PPAs/licenses have finite terms (commonly 30–35 years). A Gordon Growth (perpetuity) terminal value is theoretically questionable for an asset with a finite license term. A finite-horizon terminal value approach (or explicit license-term-bounded DCF) is more defensible than infinite-horizon Gordon growth, and should be used or at least discussed as the methodologically correct alternative in Step 13/14.
- **Data frequency: Annual, not quarterly.** Reasoning:
  - NEPSE quarterly filings are unaudited and typically only disclose top-line P&L (revenue, net profit) — not full balance sheet/cash flow detail needed for debt ratio, current ratio, ROA, ROE, asset turnover, etc.
  - Revenue seasonality (wet/dry season) is already captured more directly and cleanly via the PLF / seasonal generation split feature — quarterly P&L would be a noisier, redundant proxy for a signal already captured better elsewhere.
  - CapEx/working capital don't move in interpretable quarterly chunks for project-financed construction (disbursements follow loan covenant schedules, not calendar quarters).
  - The unit of analysis (FCF formula, train/test split, DCF horizon) is firm-*year* — mixing in quarterly predictors would create a frequency mismatch requiring awkward re-aggregation.
  - Optional forward-looking note for the paper: quarterly revenue *could* be used in future work to construct a more precise wet/dry seasonal split, but is not used here due to disclosure inconsistency across 105 firms and the annual nature of the FCF target.
- **Beta/WACC estimation:** NEPSE hydro counters are thinly traded; NEPSE-implied beta is likely noisy across 105 firms. Consider industry-average beta as an alternative, and explicitly flag this as a limitation if firm-specific beta is used.
- **Disclosure completeness varies a lot across 105 firms** (older/larger listings like Chilime, Butwal Power, Arun Valley tend to have richer annual reports; many smaller recent IPOs may only disclose bare income statement/balance sheet figures). Recommend tracking a "disclosure completeness" flag per company, usable as a control variable or basis for a robustness-check subsample.

## 7. Sample & Period

- **Sample:** 105 NEPSE-listed hydropower companies (full list held by researcher).
- **Period:** 2012–2025 (consistent with original manufacturing-sector design; actual usable years per firm vary based on listing date/COD).
- **Panel structure:** Unbalanced panel, company × year, all years included (pre- and post-COD).

## 8. Methodology Overview

### 8.1 Target Variable
**FCF** = EBIT(1 − Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization − CapEx − ΔWorking Capital
where ΔWC = WC(t) − WC(t−1)

### 8.2 Train-Test Split
Chronological (never random, to preserve time-series structure).
- Baseline plan: Train 2012–2021, Test 2022–2025 — **needs re-validation against actual firm-level data availability**, since many hydro firms IPO'd or reached COD well after 2012, which may leave the training set thin/unbalanced for those firms.

### 8.3 Baseline (Traditional) Models
1. Historical mean
2. Linear regression
3. ARIMA (optional)

### 8.4 Machine Learning Models
1. Random Forest (baseline ML)
2. XGBoost (expected strongest performer)
3. LightGBM (optional)
4. LSTM (only if sufficient observations after panel construction)

### 8.5 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE = (1/n) Σ |Actual − Predicted|
- RMSE = √[(1/n) Σ (Actual − Predicted)²]
- MAPE = |Actual − Predicted| / Actual

### 8.6 Interpretability
SHAP values applied to the best-performing model(s) to identify key FCF drivers — financial, operational, and macro/hydrology variables.

### 8.7 Statistical Testing
- Paired t-test and/or Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- Compares forecasting error (ML vs. traditional) for statistical significance
- Hypothesis: ML produces significantly lower forecasting error than traditional methods

### 8.8 DCF Valuation Stage
1. Forecast FCF for next 5 years using best ML model and using traditional method (parallel tracks).
2. Enterprise Value: EV = Σ [FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^t] + Terminal Value
3. Terminal Value — **use finite-horizon approach bounded by PPA/license term where feasible**, rather than unconditional Gordon Growth perpetuity, given finite license terms in this sector. Gordon Growth TV = FCF(n+1) / (WACC − g) may still be reported as a comparison/robustness case.
4. **Validation:** Compare both DCF outputs (ML-based vs. traditional-based) against actual NEPSE market capitalization. Whichever is closer is the headline empirical finding for RQ3.
